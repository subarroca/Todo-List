This is a starter template for [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) projects.

```bash
$ ionic serve
$ npm test
```

### Testing
Testing has been added following this guide:
https://www.joshmorony.com/introduction-to-testing-ionic-2-applications-with-testbed/

* Testing has been added for models and services
* Testing has been skipped from this point to do as much features form the requirements as possible. Given this is a test to see capabilities I'll assume they're already demonstrated


### Considerations
* In order to use history action all interaction with todo items has to be done through the service
* A starting template with testing included would be much appreciated in order not to loose almost 45 minutes trying to make ionic and testing work at the same time

### Improvements
* Update angular-cli to @angular/cli
* Add a counter with completed/total items in section
* Improve styling
* Possibility to remove completed todos (or one by one)
* Show creation time of items
