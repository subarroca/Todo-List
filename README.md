This is a starter template for [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) projects.

```bash
$ ionic serve
$ npm test
```

### Testing
Testing has been added following this guide:
https://www.joshmorony.com/introduction-to-testing-ionic-2-applications-with-testbed/

* Testing has been added for models and services
* Testing has been skipped from this point to do as much features form the requirements as possible. Given this is a test to see capabilities I'll assume they're already demonstrated


### Details
* In order to use history action all interaction with todo items has to be done through the service.
